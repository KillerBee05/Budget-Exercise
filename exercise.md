-- I decided I wanted to try React(typescript) and Flask(python). I never used either one and wanted to see if I could get bonus points ;)
-- I did find it to be challenging, but stuck with it to see if I could get through roadblocks of learning a new syntax such as typescript.

-- I didn't know everything and couldn't get passed all my roadblocks, but enjoyed the project and I wanted to thank you guys for the learning experience.

## Python Flask API
-- I chose Python because out of the given choices, it was the one I was most interested in using. I have always wanted to try Flask/Django, but just never did. I have heard only good things about it. I didn't get as much done as I wanted to and there's things I still needed to cover.

## React Typescript
-- I've used React before, however throwing Typescript on there makes it more difficult to grasp. I understand though because it gives you more structure and you can't just go javascript crazy. It contains you within guard rails, which is very important and keeps your code unified. I do plan on taking an online course for react typescript, as I think it is the future standard and to get a better understanding.

## Material UI Typescript
-- I used Material UI to spruce it up a bit.

## Firebase
-- I wanted to use Firebase to store my data and use Flask to fetch the data. I didn't get that far.   

## Run Application
-- npm install
-- cd api/venv/Scripts flask run
-- npm start
